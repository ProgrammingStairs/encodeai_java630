        iii. Static Synchronization
    b. Co-operation of thread (Inter Thread communication)
        wait(), notify() and notifyAll() 

Here Synchronized block and Synchronized methods are used to achieve object level locking whereas static Synchronization is used to achieve class level locking. 

For achieving class level locking , we needs to make Synchronized method static
